# Strawberry Chat - v1.12.0 Stable
Hey! v1.12.0 of Strawberry Chat is released with a "little" delay.
This version is rather smaller, due to the enormous size of v1.11.x.
Unfortunately, I am running out of ideas for further updates,
which is why it is difficult for me to program new features.

- Admins can now kick other users
- Improved stability 


## Next release?
As I have already mentioned, it will be difficult with future function updates for Strawberry Chat. Therefore, I cannot say a release date. But hopefully it will be this year (2024)
